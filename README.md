Never have ever have i have to be have

<pre>

I greet you from the other side
Of sorrow and despair
With a love so vast and shattered
It will reach you everywhere
And I sing this for the captain
Whose ship has not been built
For the mother in confusion
Her cradle still unfilled

For the heart with no companion
For the soul without a king
For the prima ballerina
Who cannot dance to anything

Through the days of shame that are coming
Through the nights of wild distress
Tho' your promise count for nothing
You must keep it nonetheless

You must keep it for the captain
Whose ship has not been built
For the mother in confusion
Her cradle still unfilled

For the heart with no companion ...

I greet you from the other side ...

## Dark

<pre>
In the dark, dark wood, There was a dark, dark house.

And in the dark, dark house, there was a dark, dark room.

And in the dark, dark room, There was a dark, dark cupboard.

And in the dark, dark cupboard, There was a dark dark shelf.

And on the dark, dark shelf, There was a dark, dark box.

And in the dark, dark box,  there was a big white ghost!

This old man, he played six
He played knick knack picking up sticks
With a knick knack paddy whack
Give the dog a bone
This old man came rolling home.

This old man, he played seven
He played knick knack up to heaven
With a knick knack paddy whack
Give the dog a bone
This old man came rolling home.

This old man, he played eight
He played knick knack on the gate
With a knick knack paddy whack
Give the dog a bone
This old man came rolling home.

This old man, he played nine
He played knick knack all the time
With a knick knack paddy whack
Give the dog a bone
This old man came rolling home.

This old man, he played ten
He played knick knack over again
With a knick knack paddy whack
Give the dog a bone
This old man came rolling home.
