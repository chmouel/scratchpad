<pre>
In the dark, dark wood, There was a dark, dark house.

And in the dark, dark house, there was a dark, dark room.

And in the dark, dark room, There was a dark, dark cupboard.

And in the dark, dark cupboard, There was a dark dark shelf.

And on the dark, dark shelf, There was a dark, dark box.

And in the dark, dark box,  there was a big white ghost!

This old man, he played six
He played knick knack picking up sticks
With a knick knack paddy whack
Give the dog a bone
This old man came rolling home.

This old man, he played seven
He played knick knack up to heaven
With a knick knack paddy whack
Give the dog a bone
This old man came rolling home.

This old man, he played eight
He played knick knack on the gate
With a knick knack paddy whack
Give the dog a bone
This old man came rolling home.

This old man, he played nine
He played knick knack all the time
With a knick knack paddy whack
Give the dog a bone
This old man came rolling home.

This old man, he played ten
He played knick knack over again
With a knick knack paddy whack
Give the dog a bone
This old man came rolling home.
